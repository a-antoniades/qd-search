        I'm trying to optimize training for the nanoGPT autoresearch speedrun. The goal is to reach the lowest possible BPB (bits per byte) within the time limit.
        The model uses the autoresearch architecture: RoPE, squared ReLU, value embeddings, MuonAdamW optimizer, sliding window attention, and softcap logits.
        Below is the list of all code files in this codebase including the example script to launch a job:

        Below is the list of all ideas that have been tried and their BPB:

        For your reference, the baseline code can reach a final BPB of {baseline_threshold}.
        Now I want you to generate {num_ideas} brand new ideas that are different from all the previous ideas.
        You should explore novel ideas that have not been well-established in pretraining research yet. I'm looking for some clean and simple ideas instead of stacking many known tricks together or simply tweaking the hyperparameters.
        For each experiment, include two sub-sections: (1) concise description of the experiment; (2) brief summary of the code changes needed. Format each block with the following tags:
        [Experiment] ...
        [Code Changes] ...
        Add a tag [End] after each experiment.
        If the experiment involves changing any hyperparameters, you should specify the new values of the hyperparameters.
        External imports are not supported so you should suggest experiments that can be implemented by directly changing a few functions in the codebase.
        Also note that you are not allowed to change any part of the evaluation logic, including the BPB computation, token_bytes loading, or the validation hyperparameters including val_loss_every and val_tokens (we only do the evaluation at the end of training). You are not allowed to change the time limit in "if elapsed_time_seconds > 1500:" either. These must be left unchanged for fair comparison!
        Also avoid any possible case of leaking information from future tokens that breaks the autoregressive nature of the model. For example, you should not mix in any future tokens into the current token's representation or normalize across the entire sequence.
